Three Obvservable Trends within the Data - Responses

1) 	When analyzing purchases mad by the age group, there seems to be somewhat of a bell-shaped curve. Although,
this specific analysis is beyond our scope, it is something to note because of the potential narrative. We notice the 
20-24 age group has made the most purchases (365), follwed by 15-19 (136) and closely behind that, 25-29 (101). As 
we get to less than 10 and greater than 40, we see that these numbers drop to 23 and 13 respectively. 


2)	A second drastic trend that was noticed in hte analysis was the heavy presense of male players. 84% of the 
game's players are male, while 14% are female with a remaining 1.9 % undisclosed. With that said, it may come to no 
surprise that male purchases far exceed female purchases and non-discloded gender purchases. This total purchase value 
is $1,967 compared to the $361 made by females and $50 in our remaining group. What is noticable is how the male's 
average purchase per person is less than that of the females. It is 40 cents less ($4.47 compared to $4.07)

3)	Our last trend that is in the data but not quite noticable is how most of the most popular items also happen
to be the most profitable. However, items, "Persuasion" and "Extraction, Quickblade of Trembling Hands" don't make it 
onto the most profitable becasue they are priced roughly $3.50 and below whereas other items that are most profitable 
are no lower that $4.23. In other words, this could lead to a narrative that they may be popular because they are 'cheap'
and people are willing to buy that lower-priced item.
